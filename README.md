## TODO

### ONBOARDING
* Tutorial Messages
    * Putting dice with matching numbers in
    * Giving items to customers
    * Putting dice with matching colors in
    * Waiting for next delivery of dice + any unused decay
* Tutorial functionality
    * no decaying
* Tutorial level with special rules...?

### UX
* error messages if you try to deliver something that isn't a product
* NEW DELIVERY text burst (and full)
* nobody wants this error message for counter

### CORE FUNCTIONALITY
* Exchanging food for points
* lose screen
* happiness counter
* Make sure you can't put finished items into the oven
* Game pause should stop timers going down
* game pause and game over should stop player moving
* put down things back onto belt
* use dice count to make score when using colours
* remove freshenss
* lower happiness when things decay

### COSMETIC
* Dice should appear on oven
* Music
* sound effects
* customers are just capsules

### NICE TO HAVE
* put down in closest slot on shelf not first available
* recipies over people
* tweens/animations for picking up items/ putting down
* also show icons requested on counter
* oven smoosh

### UI AND MENUS
* truck UI for next delivery
* pause
* transition manager

### BUGS
* picking up more stuff from ovens should be possible
* lock the players position Y
* stop ovens bouncing
