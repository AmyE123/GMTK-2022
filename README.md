## TODO

### ONBOARDING
* Tutorial Messages
    * Putting dice with matching numbers in
    * Giving items to customers
    * Freshness bonus
    * Putting dice with matching colors in
    * Waiting for next delivery of dice + any unused decay
* Tutorial functionality
    * specific orders
    * no decaying
* Tutorial level with special rules...?

### UX
* error messages when putting food into oven?
* error messages if you try to deliver something that isn't a product

### CORE FUNCTIONALITY
* Food expiring
    * shown with steam
* Exchanging food for points
* Time limits
* loading a level from playerprefs or something
* the bin
* win screen
* lose screen
* happiness counter
* Make sure you can't put finished items into the oven
* Make the shelf customisable size on startup

### ARTWORK
* Oven
* Textures for floor

### COSMETIC
* tweens/animations for picking up items/ putting down
* also show icons requested on counter
* Dice should appear on oven
* visuals for oven in progress
* Background pattern

### NICE TO HAVE
* put down in closest slot on shelf not first available

### UI AND MENUS
* Title screen
* level select
* truck UI for next delivery
* restart level
* pause
* transition manager

### BUGS
* It's possible to pick up a dice as it's disappearing and this causes errors
* picking up more stuff from ovens should be possible

### DEBUG CLEANUP
* remove clicking on dice to kill
* remove inputtnig number keys to change values
